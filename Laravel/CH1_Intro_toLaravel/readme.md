### MVC (Model View Controller)

- The MVC is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main
  logical components `Model, View, and Controller`.
- Each of these component has their own role in a Project.

- MVC model was first introduced in 1987 in the Smalltalk programming language.

- More than 80% of all web app frameworks rely on the Model View Controller
  architecture.

#### Model

- The model is responsible for getting data from a database, packaging it in data objects that can be understood by other components, and delivering those objects, most of which will happen in response to input from the controller.

#### View

- It represents how data should be presented to the application user. User can read or write the data from view.

- Basically it is responsible for showing end user content, we can say it is user interface.

- It may consists of HTML, CSS, JS.

#### Controller

- The user can send request by interacting with view, the controller handles these requests and sends to Model then get appropriate response from the Model, sends response to View.

- It may also have required logics.

- It Works as a mediator between View and Model
